            <p>The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley reimagines the legend of King Arthur from the perspectives of the women at the heart of the story, weaving a tale of power, spirituality, and destiny. At the center is Morgaine (known as Morgan le Fay in traditional tales), a priestess of Avalon and Arthur’s sister, who is devoted to preserving the old pagan ways of the Goddess as Christianity spreads across Britain.</p>
			<p>Through Morgaine’s eyes, as well as those of Queen Guinevere, the Lady of the Lake, and Arthur’s mother, Igraine, the novel explores the shifting political and spiritual forces that shape Camelot and its fate. As Arthur rises to power, conflicts arise not only on the battlefield but also in the struggle for Britain’s spiritual identity, and the bonds between family, love, and loyalty are tested in heartbreaking ways.</p>
			<p>Bradley’s richly atmospheric novel offers a fresh and complex view of familiar legends, bringing depth and agency to the often-sidelined female characters. The Mists of Avalon is celebrated for its powerful portrayal of women’s roles in myth and history, and its exploration of faith, ambition, and the enduring mystery of Avalon.</p>
