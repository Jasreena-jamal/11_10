			<p>Ead Duryan is an outsider at court. Though she has risen to the position of lady-in-waiting, she is loyal to a hidden society of mages. Ead keeps a watchful eye on Sabran, secretly protecting her with forbidden magic.</p>
			<p>Across the dark sea, Tané has trained to be a dragonrider since she was a child, but is forced to make a choice that could see her life unravel. </p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the divided East and West refuse to parley, and forces of chaos are rising from their sleep. </p>
