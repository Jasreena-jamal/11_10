            <p>Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a beloved coming-of-age novel that follows the lives of the four March sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy—as they grow up in Civil War-era New England. Raised by their caring mother, Marmee, while their father is away at war, the sisters face the challenges of adolescence, family struggles, and personal dreams with warmth, humor, and resilience.</p>
			<p>Each sister has her own personality and ambitions: Meg, the responsible eldest, dreams of a traditional life; Jo, the spirited writer, seeks independence and adventure; Beth, the gentle soul, finds joy in music and home; and Amy, the youngest, aspires to become a successful artist. As they navigate love, loss, friendship, and the pursuit of their dreams, the sisters learn valuable lessons about loyalty, sacrifice, and the meaning of family. </p>
			<p>Little Women is a timeless story of sisterhood and self-discovery, celebrated for its relatable characters and moral depth. Alcott’s novel remains a classic, cherished for its portrayal of family bonds, personal growth, and the enduring power of love and compassion. </p>
