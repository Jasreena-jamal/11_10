		  <p>Normal People by Sally Rooney is a poignant exploration of love, friendship, and the complexities of human relationships. The novel follows the intertwined lives of Connell Waldron and Marianne Sheridan, two teenagers from a small Irish town. Despite their differences—Connell is popular and well-liked, while Marianne is an outsider and often misunderstood—their connection deepens as they navigate the trials of adolescence. </p>
		  <p>As they move from high school to university, their relationship evolves through moments of intimacy and distance, reflecting the challenges of communication and self-discovery. Connell struggles with his identity and the expectations of his peers, while Marianne confronts her own sense of belonging and self-worth. </p>
		  <p>Rooney's narrative captures the raw emotions and intricacies of young adulthood, exploring themes of class, mental health, and the impact of social dynamics on personal connections. With its lyrical prose and deeply relatable characters, Normal People offers a profound commentary on the nature of love and the struggles of truly knowing oneself and others. </p>
