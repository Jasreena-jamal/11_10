            <p>The Princess Bride by William Goldman is a delightful blend of adventure, romance, and satire, set in the fictional land of Florin. The story revolves around the beautiful Buttercup and her true love, Westley, a humble farm boy who leaves to seek his fortune but is reported dead at sea. Heartbroken, Buttercup reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck, a scheming nobleman with plans of his own.</p>
			<p>However, Buttercup’s fate changes when she is kidnapped by an unlikely trio—a clever Sicilian named Vizzini, a giant named Fezzik, and a master swordsman named Inigo Montoya, who seeks revenge on the man who killed his father. Soon, a mysterious figure known as the Man in Black appears, determined to rescue Buttercup and win her heart once more.</p>
			<p>Packed with sword fights, daring rescues, humor, and unforgettable characters, The Princess Bride is both a playful satire of fairy tales and a heartfelt story about true love, friendship, and adventure. Goldman's witty narrative style, full of charm and irony, has made this story a timeless favorite, celebrated for its humor, excitement, and enduring romance.</p>
