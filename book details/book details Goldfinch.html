            <p>In The Goldfinch, thirteen-year-old Theo Decker's life is upended when he survives a tragic accident that claims his mother. Left adrift in New York with a negligent father, he is taken in by a wealthy friend’s family. Haunted by grief, Theo clings to a small, mesmerizing painting that evokes his lost mother. Over time, the painting becomes both his comfort and a connection to the criminal underworld, drawing him into a labyrinth of danger. As he matures, Theo navigates the glittering world of Manhattan’s elite and the gritty charm of an antique shop where he works, all while struggling with love, loss, and alienation.
			<p>The Goldfinch is a powerful tale of modern America, rich with unforgettable characters and suspense. It's a captivating journey through heartbreak and obsession, exploring survival, identity, and the mysteries of fate and love. </p>
