			<p>The Kite Runner tells the unforgettable story of Amir, a young boy from a wealthy family in Kabul, and Hassan, the son of Amir’s father’s servant. Set against a backdrop of a divided Afghanistan on the brink of turmoil, the two boys share a deep bond, bound by friendship and the joy of kite flying. However, one tragic incident shatters their lives and drives them apart, leaving Amir haunted by guilt and regret.</p>
			<p>Years later, now an adult in America, Amir is given a chance to confront his past and seek redemption. His journey back to Afghanistan—now scarred by war—unearths buried secrets and brings him face-to-face with the possibility of making things right. </p>
