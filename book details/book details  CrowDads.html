            <p>Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is a captivating coming-of-age story set against the backdrop of the North Carolina marshes. The novel follows Kya Clark, known as the "Marsh Girl," who grows up isolated from society after being abandoned by her family. As a child, Kya learns to survive in the wild, developing a deep connection with nature and the creatures around her. </p>
