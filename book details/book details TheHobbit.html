            <p>The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a classic fantasy adventure that follows the unexpected journey of Bilbo Baggins, a quiet, comfort-loving hobbit from the Shire. Bilbo’s peaceful life is turned upside down when the wizard Gandalf and a group of thirteen dwarves arrive, seeking his help on a daring quest to reclaim their homeland and treasure from the fearsome dragon Smaug.</p>
			<p>Reluctantly joining the adventure, Bilbo travels through perilous lands, encountering trolls, goblins, elves, and giant spiders. Along the way, he discovers hidden courage and resourcefulness within himself, even coming into possession of a mysterious and powerful ring. Through bravery and cleverness, Bilbo proves himself invaluable to the company and transforms from a timid hobbit into a true hero.</p>
			<p>The Hobbit is a timeless tale of friendship, courage, and self-discovery, filled with richly imagined landscapes and unforgettable characters. Tolkien’s enchanting storytelling has made it a beloved introduction to Middle-earth, celebrated for its charm, humor, and sense of wonder.</p>
